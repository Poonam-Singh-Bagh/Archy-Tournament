# Archy-Tournament

In this project, I have made a Scoreboard of a game named as Archy Tournament using Python. The team names and participants names are in json file. There are 2 teams and 2 players for each team. In scoreboard we can see individual players, teams and bonus scores. You need to give input for the archery board which has 5 concentric circles of A, B, C, D, E, F whose values are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 respectively. Points for every circle increase by 1 at every round. For example, In the 4th round, A will carry 8 points while E will carry 4 points. Hitting outside the board (F) will always be 0. 
If both archers in a team hit the same circle in a round, a bonus 2 points are given to the team for synchronicity. 
The game finishes when one team reaches 60 points. If more than one team cross 60 points in a round, the team with the highest score wins.
